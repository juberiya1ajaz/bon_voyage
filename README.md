# The SØLØ  BaGpackr
Let's pack our bags and wander through the mountains and beaches

## 💡 Inspiration
For many folks, there is one thing that is the epitome of self-indulgence, and that indulgence is none other than solo traveling. But Alas,  for women and teenage solo travelers, it comes with many paranoid thoughts. It is tough to be a woman and a solo traveler simultaneously.
To tackle this issue, We focused on developing a feasible solution for the safety of solo travelers throughout the brainstorming process. 

## 💻 What it does
The application is built on these key components:
 - Pin the locations you visited so that people can know which place is worth a visit
 - In case you feel lonely during this indulgence, Chat with other people in various public chatrooms. 
- Share your memories with other people.
 - Send an SOS in case of any emergency

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Firebase: For backend
- Tailwind CSS: For styling

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
- Brainstorming: It took a long time for us to develop this idea that had a real influence after grueling brainstorming. Most of our teammates were busy with the preparation of their papers and viva and at the same time, we were clueless about what to build. 
- Managing our scope such that we delivered a genuine product in a short period of time
- Some of our teammates are new to Tailwind CSS and Firebase  so they have to learn about the bare bones of Tailwind and firebase.
- Utilising the backend 
- Building the SOS feature
- Implementing the chatroom

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

-  We think that our application will help enhance solo traveling and will provide a safer option for vulnerable folks out there.
